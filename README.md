This project involves an exploratory data analysis of the given data. An ANN model is trained to classify fashion images into labels based on the values of their pixels(784 pixels were given).
It involved one-hot encoding the labels and dealing with sparse matrices. Finally, an accuracy of 83.7% was achieved.
